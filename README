This is my try at following http://open.gl/.  It contains the code necessary to
run the examples and some of the exercises.  The code isn't beautifully
organized, as it's my first contact with OpenGL and I'm not sure on what's the
best way to abstract it, yet.

Dependencies:
  - OpenGL 3.1 (I should be using at least 3.2 according to the material, but I
    don't have a GPU at the moment and it's the best my Sandy Bridge can do);
  - GLEW
  - GLFW
  - GLM
  - SOIL

You'll also need a C++11 compiler and GNU Make.
